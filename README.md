## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RajendharAre/ML_Algoritms.git
   cd ML_Algoritms
2. **Install Dependencies**
   This project uses only basic Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
3. **Run an Algorithm**
   Navigate to the desired algorithm folder and execute the example:
   ```bash
   cd LinearRegression
   python example.py
  Each example.py file demonstrates how the algorithm works on sample data with basic visualization.
